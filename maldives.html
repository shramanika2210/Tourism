            <span class="history-caption">In the 6th - 5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms. The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends. Early settlers in the Maldives were probably Gujaratis who reached and settled Sri Lanka about 500 BCE. Evidence of cultural influence from North India can be deduced from the methods of boatbuilding and silver punch-marked coins. The Mahāvaṃsa (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to the Maldives. Assuming that cowrie shells come from the Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in the Maldives during the Indus Valley civilisation (3300-1300 BCE). A number of artefacts show the presence of Hinduism in the country before the Islamic period.</span><br><br>

            <!-- Etymology -->
            <h3 class="history-heading2">Etymology</h3><br>
            <p class="history-para">
                The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit माला mālā (garland) and द्वीप dvīpa (island), or මාල දිවයින Maala Divaina ("Necklace Islands") in Sinhala. The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin. The word Dheeb/Deeb (archaic Dhivehi, related to Sanskrit द्वीप, dvīpa) means "island", and Dhives (Dhivehin) means "islanders" (i.e., Maldivians). In Tamil, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as Maalai Theevu (மாலைத்தீவு).The ancient Sri Lankan chronicle Mahawamsa refers to an island called Mahiladiva ("Island of Women", महिलादिभ) in Pali, which is probably[according to whom?] a mistranslation of the same Sanskrit word meaning "garland".

            <p class="history-para">The Maldives has a long and rich heritage of arts and crafts and the country is home to some of the most skilled craftsmen in the world. Ancient traditions have been passed from generation to generation and the arts and crafts made today are a testament to these age-old skills. Arts and crafts of the Maldives are created using mostly raw materials that are easily available such as palm leaves, reeds, coral, wood, shells, stones, coir, natural oils, and paints, and traditional Maldivian crafts include liyelaa jehun (lacquer work), mat weaving, boat building, coir-rope making, and fangi vinun (thatch-weaving)</p><br><br>
